![The setup for pu-erh.sk's 2009 Jingmai by Douji](setup.jpeg)

Today I tried another sample of my first pu-erh.sk purchase.
This time it is another Sheng from Jingmai.

As with all new samples my choice in terms of brewing comes down to using a Gaiwan.

The first steepings present a subtle sweetness combined with pleasant bitter notes.
In the beginning, I only used some seconds for brewing the tea. But I had the feeling,
that I did not yet meet the core of this tea.
After increasing the steeping time (to around 30 seconds) the tea unfolds - and shows some very green, raw notes. I personally love Shengs, so this is exactly what I like!
Although, it does not really offer some more/deeper complexity. Some would probably even argue, that the tea just became more bitter.
The fruitiness is constant and is a great enhancement to the bitterness. Also aftertaste leaves a nice tingling on the tongue and resolves in huigan.
This tea is quite robust and keeps entertaining you for more than 10 steepings, before slowly fading out.
Qi-wise I am sadly not feeling much at all. A bit of burping but no mental sensation whatsoever.

In summary I would say that this tea is a great example of introducing someone to the world of (sheng) Puerh. Also for the experienced folks it might be a good daily
