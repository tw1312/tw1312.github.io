I am very excited! Today I am going to try my first tea from the taiwanese `Yuan Yuan Tang` boutique brand. For me this is also new territory as I am not really familiar with those boutique brands in general. Definitely they are significantly more expensive. So I hope it is worth the extra dollar - let's see! :-)

The fragrance when rinsing the tea is very intense. Lots of grass notes. Also there is some perfume like scent which I can not really describe. The first steeping tastes very good, but still very light. As if the tea still hides its true potential and waits to be awakened from its slumber. So I will keep the steeping times a little longer to find out its secret.
The fragrance gets more dense, almost a little like a vegetable broth. Also some pepper spices mix into it - I like. Some astringency is also present, but not in an unpleasant way, quite the opposite it mixes well with the sweetness of the tea.
After a couple more steepings a more mineraly taste comes through and mingles very nicely with the bitterness. Although the tea is "only" 14 years as of writing, it tastes like it had some more years on its back. In terms of qi I don't get many sensations - but to be fair I am currently also doing something on the side and not fully focused on the tea.

So that's it! The first tea from `Yuan Yuan Tang` and it is a very good one! At the beginning I mentioned the higher price tag due to the boutique brand. Turns out I was quite wrong! The bing (357g!) is available for around $100. For that price you get a great experience of what a proper aged Sheng can taste like. Excited to try more from this brand!
