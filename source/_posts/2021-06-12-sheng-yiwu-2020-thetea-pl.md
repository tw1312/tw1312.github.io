This tea I got as a 20g sample. I bought it together with several other samples as my first purchase from `thetea.pl`.
The first steep has typical Yiwu tasting notes. Refreshing but still a subtle astringent character.

Second steep is more intense and has some pleasant bitterness. The third steeping is not much different. For all of them I used water at around 96C. The steeping took a few seconds each. 


For the fourth steeping I increased the steeping time - the tea is much more intense and shows fleshy and mushroomy characteristics. Still, it has a very clean taste.
