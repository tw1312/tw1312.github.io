Continuing my journey of exploring Thai Puerh, I treated myself with this delicious sample from puerh.sk.

<!-- more -->

The tea starts very subtle and without much intensity. Its much on the green and grassy side.
Being so light and green it is a great drink in summer time!
It's getting more intense after bumping up the steeping time, which also offers some nice nutty aroma with a pleasant bitterness.
Pushing the tea to its limits, by letting it steep for a while, the astringent taste is becoming slightly too strong - even for my taste! So take care when brewing this tea.

Another good daily drink from puerh.sk. I am missing the thrill in the past recent reviews I made on this blog. I should probably place a new order for some exquisite puerh tea - so stay tuned! :-)
And if you are into japanese green tea, don't forget ordering some fresh Shincha. Its one of my favorite teas during summertime.
