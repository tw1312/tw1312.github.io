Another Yuan Yuan Tang tea! The last time I drank my first YYT tea and it was great.
Let's see how this first impression continues with this tea. Slightly younger sheng from 2014.

Today I am feeling like using short notes within the following list:

- Sweet and clean tea for the first steepings
- Quite dormant within the first one or two steepings
- Slight smokiness
- Definitely some similarities to the previous YYT tea
- Especially in this woody and perfume like scent - I like!
- Grassy notes
- Slight pepper notes
- Very nice but still a little too weak for my taste
- Cherries
- Bitterness blends in well with the sweetness

In summary a very nice tea! But also nothing that blows me away. The sample cost me 19â‚¬ for 25g. Which is definitely a fair deal. But there are even better teas out there for the same price.
