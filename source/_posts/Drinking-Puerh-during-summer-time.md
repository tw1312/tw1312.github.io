A refreshing cup of raw puerh is what I need on such a hot day - even though it is already September!
If you demand the same, then this tea is for you. :-)

Since it is already hot enough I prefer to steep with a lower temperature than boiling today - the tea has no problem with those temperatures and it is more refreshing this way.

Overall this tea scores with its intense fruity notes. Subtle citrus notes & astringency make it perfect for hot weather.
In particular I get lots of orange notes from this tea. But also some tropical fruits like mango appear. Due to the aging process it has a slight shou note to it which rounds of the whole sweetness direction in a nice way.
What the tea does not offer is a lot of complexity. It is a very straight forward tea that is easy to drink and has a great mouth feeling.
But who needs complexity when the weather is hot? Give yourself a break sometimes üèùÔ∏è. 

In summary this is a great daily drinker and I can recommend it to anyone who likes fruity notes.
