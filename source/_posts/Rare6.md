This sample is from the first purchase from pu-erh.sk and I am not disappointed!
For its young age ({{ year }}) the first unusual impression are the very dark leaves. The [description](https://www.pu-erh.sk/product/rare6-20/) also indicates that the leave material is sourced from very old trees. Sadly, the concrete Province in Yunnan is not provided in the description.

I used {{ gramm }} g and a Gaiwan to have a neutral ground for this new tea and vendor.
The first two steepings did not really reveal anything unusual. To be honest, I was even a bit disappointed since I was awaiting some sort of extraordinary aroma or taste. Rather, it offered a mild and sweet taste - which was still superior! The aroma reminded me of some berries mixed with grass. No smokiness present.
For the next steepings the tea behaves very stable - even if the steeping time is increased heavily. I tried to tickle the dirty and intense corners of this tea, without much success. It seems to be very robust and continues with sweet notes and the uniqueness in taste that one only gets from Gushu.
While the taste was not really outstanding to me the Qi that I got was one of the best I've ever head. It was striking after the 2-3 cup and lasted over hours. And it is a very pleasant Qi that is not too direct but still unfolds very clearly. It expresses as a very subtle high state - absolutely suitable for an extended sunday afternoon.


<!--
1st brewing
- relativ mild; noch nichts ungewöhnliches

2st 
-  immer noch sehr mild aber auch süß

3st
- astringenz kommt hinzu - ansonsten eher unauffällig

4th
- still very subtle although very strong characteristics of QI are coming through. Subtle high state (cha zui)

5th

In summary I much enjoyed that tea. Even though I expected some more funkiness and excitement in the tasting profile it still satisfied me in terms of the provided QI. For further sessions I would prefer to have a more intense tea water ratio which was maybe a bit too low with {{ gramm }} g. I highly recommend to try that tea if you are interested into what Qi means when drinking puerh tea.
