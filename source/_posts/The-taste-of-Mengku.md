Mengku? What's that?
After knowing this region for several years know, it is surprisingly hard to find a proper definition.
So let's stay with this: It is a region. And that region is quite famous for producing high quality puerh tea!

<!-- more -->

The tea starts off with intense grassy notes, a bit of bitterness and a good portion of astringency. Frankly, nothing too special, rather average.
Consequent steepings stay the same but slowly evolve some mellow character, which I really enjoy. This goes very well with the all present astringency, which I really like, but doesn't knock you out in that combination.
Going on, the tea evolves and lets me think of spices like cinnamon.
These later steepings really bought me in: The herb characteristics intensifies while the mellow and full bodied unfolds. Great!
In general it is very potent and keeps on going long after 10 steepings.

**Summary**: I enjoyed this tea. I think it fits great as a daily drinker. But I am missing some "complexity"/more interesting characteristics in it. 
So while the title is {{ title }} don't take it as too representative. As for every tea region there is of course a large variety.
Please let me know if you have any other better definition for Mengku or some representative tea from the area.
